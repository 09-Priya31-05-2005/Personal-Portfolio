**Overview**
This personal portfolio website serves as a comprehensive, interactive digital resume for Priyadarshini, highlighting her academic achievements, technical and creative skills, major projects, and contact information. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an intuitive interface and a smooth user experience. A major highlight of the portfolio is the clean layout featuring split screens, light/dark mode toggling, typing animation on the homepage, and click-based navigation that dynamically reveals each section without reloading the page.

### **Design & Aesthetics**

The design uses a modern, responsive layout with a fixed navigation bar and visually pleasing transitions. The homepage features a side-by-side layout with a circular profile image on the left and a welcome message with a typing animation on the right. The site supports **Dark Mode**, offering accessibility and reducing eye strain, which can be toggled via a moon/sun button in the navigation bar.

Each section is modular and animates into view, improving readability and user engagement. CSS media queries ensure it performs well across desktops, tablets, and mobile screens. The entire UI emphasizes clean typography, soft accents, and user-centered interaction.
