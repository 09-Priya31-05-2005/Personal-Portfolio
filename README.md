**Overview**
This personal portfolio website serves as a comprehensive, interactive digital resume for Priyadarshini, highlighting her academic achievements, technical and creative skills, major projects, and contact information. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an intuitive interface and a smooth user experience. A major highlight of the portfolio is the clean layout featuring split screens, light/dark mode toggling, typing animation on the homepage, and click-based navigation that dynamically reveals each section without reloading the page.

### **Design & Aesthetics**

The design uses a modern, responsive layout with a fixed navigation bar and visually pleasing transitions. The homepage features a side-by-side layout with a circular profile image on the left and a welcome message with a typing animation on the right. The site supports **Dark Mode**, offering accessibility and reducing eye strain, which can be toggled via a moon/sun button in the navigation bar.
